	twitter columns.

version 0.5.1 (5/18/08)

sorry for the short release cycle (i did warn you to use at your own risk).
i released 0.5 in haste and did not do the work to store the twitter stuff
in mysql -- nor did i write up any of the front-end stuff to take care of
getting your twitter stuff into the db.

please see below for upgrading from 0.5 to 0.5.1 and taking advantage of the
twitter settings enhancements.

	+ go to "site admin" and there will be a link to "twitter settings"

	  updating twitter along with your mindof.
